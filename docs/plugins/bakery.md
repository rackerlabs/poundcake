# Bakery Plugin

## Status

- Service type: `bakery`
- Tier: `supported`
- External service: remote Bakery deployment

## Purpose

`bakery` is the supported communication plugin for remote provider ticketing and
notifications. PoundCake owns order flow and plugin identity; Bakery owns
provider-native ticket and notification behavior.

## Requirements

- A reachable Bakery deployment.
- A Bakery-issued bootstrap HMAC Secret applied in the PoundCake namespace.
- Helm `bakery.client.enabled=true`, `bakery.client.baseUrl`, and
  `bakery.client.auth.existingSecret`. The chart appends `bakery` to
  `config.enabledPlugins` when the client is enabled.
- Matching monitor ID: `bakery.client.monitor.id` or `<namespace>/<release>`.
- `bakery.client.accountNumber` when Core tickets should use a default account.
  That value is Helm-only; it is not a Plugins UI or CLI configuration field.
- After registration, a `bakery_monitor_hmac` credential row with
  `credential_key_id=default` stored by the bakery plugin.

## Operator configuration

Production Bakery setup is documented in
[`REMOTE_BAKERY.md`](../REMOTE_BAKERY.md). Mint the bootstrap credential with
Bakery's `create-monitor-bootstrap.sh`, apply the printed Secret, and set the
remote client Helm values. The bakery plugin registers with Bakery and writes
the issued monitor HMAC through credential-manager. Do not seed Bakery
credentials with direct SQL.

The Plugins UI and `cakectl plugins` can inspect health, edit non-secret
connection settings, write a recovery HMAC, and run a connection test. They
cannot replace Helm for bootstrap registration or the default Core account.

## Enabled behavior

- Communication operations: open/create, notify/comment, update, and close.
- Dish execution evidence: when Expediter provides completed dish evidence in
  the execution context, Bakery includes it in the outgoing communication
  `context.evidence` payload so tickets and comments carry the validation and
  inspection history gathered by earlier recipe steps.
- Scheduled plugin health checks.
- Bootstrap credential registration with remote Bakery.

## Payload contracts

Operation-level `payload_schema` validation is authoritative. Invalid payloads
are rejected before adapter execution.

Ticket creation operations (`open` and `create`) require:

- `title`
- `description`
- `source`
- `context`

The creation payload and its nested `context` object are fail-closed: only the
documented fields are accepted.

Ticket mutation operations (`notify`, `update`, and `close`) require a
resolvable ticket identifier. Recipes may provide it as top-level
`service_payload.ticket_id` or inside `service_payload.context` using one of:

- `ticket_id`
- `bakery_ticket_id`
- `bakery_comms_id`
- `communication_id`

Mutation payloads and their nested `context` object are also fail-closed. The
payload may include the documented ticket identifier fields, standard
communication fields, and no unsupported extras.

The adapter also resolves those same keys from execution context paths produced
by prior dish steps, including `context.ticket_id`, `context.bakery_ticket_id`,
`context.bakery_comms_id`, `context.communication_id`, and the same keys under
`context.dish.context_updates`.

The `incident_reconcile.reconcile` operation accepts only an optional integer
`limit`.

The `collect` operations (`monitor_diagnostics`, `cluster_inventory`, and
`ticket_context`) accept only these optional fields: integer `order_id`, string
`req_id`, string `bakery_ticket_id`, string `namespace`, and integer `limit`
from 1 through 200.
